This Bash script automates essential network operations while ensuring user anonymity. It begins by checking for and installing necessary dependencies silently, streamlining the setup process. Once dependencies are in place, the script configures and starts the Nipe tool, facilitating anonymous network activities.

Features:

Dependency Management: Checks for and installs necessary dependencies, including nmap, geoiplookup, sshpass, and whois, ensuring a seamless setup process.
Anonymity Setup: Configures and starts the Nipe tool, enabling users to conduct network operations anonymously by routing traffic through the Tor network.
SSH Connection: Establishes an SSH connection to remote machines, allowing users to perform various operations, such as retrieving system information, executing commands, conducting WHOIS queries, and running Nmap scans remotely.
Comprehensive Logging: Logs all actions performed during remote operations, including WHOIS queries and Nmap scans, providing a comprehensive record for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.
